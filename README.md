# Py Me Up, Charlie

## Background

Welcome to the world of programming with Python! In this challenge, you'll apply Python scripting skills on two separate datasets, PyBank and PyPoll. 

Before You Begin:
1. Create a new repository for this project called python-challenge.
2. Clone the new repository to your computer.
3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for both of the Python challenges. Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: PyBank and PyPoll.
4. Inside of each folder that you just created, add the following:
    - A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.
    - A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files you used. Make sure your script has the correct path to the CSV file.
    - An "analysis" folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis.
5. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.
